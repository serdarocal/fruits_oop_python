# GroceryStore
<p>Using this project, you can buy certain fruits from a small grocery store for a certain amount of money. It also shows whether the fruits are fresh or not.<p/>
To-do List:

- [x] Fruit object will be created
- [X] 3 new fruit objects will be created
- [X] Basket object will be created
- [X] Store object will be created
- [X] User object will be created
- [X] CLI will be created
- [X] Simulation will be created
- [X] Polymorphism will be added (Fresh or Not Fresh)
- Polymorphism works as follows: Each fruit has its own decay time and each fruit has a random picking date. If the difference between the shopping day and the date of receipt of the fruit is more than the fruit's decay time, the fruit is considered not fresh; otherwise, it is considered fresh.
