# GroceryStore
<p>Using this project, you can buy certain fruits from a small grocery store for a certain amount of money. It also shows whether the fruits are fresh or not.<p/>
To-do List:

- [x] Fruit object will be created
- [X] 3 new fruit objects will be created
- [X] Basket object will be created
- [X] Store object will be created
- [X] User object will be created
- [X] CLI will be created
- [X] Simulation will be created
- [X] Polymorphism will be added (Fresh or Not Fresh & Storage condition)
- <b>We are creating Apple, Banana, Orange, and Kiwi objects from the Fruit class through inheritance. These objects are automatically instantiated using the parameters sent to the superclass's constructor method. We encounter polymorphism where we can apply the same method to all objects of different classes within the items[] array. Additionally, the get_type() method returns the name of the class. Even though it is not overridden in the subclasses, its effect is still observed.
- Polymorphism works as follows: Each fruit has its own decay time and each fruit has a random picking date. If the difference between the shopping day and the date of receipt of the fruit is more than the fruit's decay time, the fruit is considered not fresh; otherwise, it is considered fresh.Storage condition provides information about which fruits should be stored at room temperature and which ones should be kept in the refrigerator.</b>
